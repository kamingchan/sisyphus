> Idle Always Free compute instances may be reclaimed by Oracle. Oracle will deem virtual machine and bare metal compute instances as idle if, during a 7-day period, the following are true:
>
> - CPU utilization for the 95th percentile is less than 10%
> - Network utilization is less than 10%
> - Memory utilization is less than 10% (applies to A1 shapes only)
